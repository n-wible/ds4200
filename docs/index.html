      <h1>Nick's Photography Site</h1>
      <p>
        I’m Nick, a Data Science & Finance student at Northeastern. When I'm not studying or working, I usually relax
        by either working on my car, or spending time in nature by hiking and doing photography. I shoot on an older
        Sony A6000, with a Sigma 16mm f/1.4, or the 16-50mm and 55-210mm kit lenses. I only really like taking landscape
        shots, and focus a lot on nature-related shots. Though I have a great camera, the majority of my shots are from
        my iPhone 14 Pro, because I can't be hauling a camera everywhere.
      </p>

        Editing the photo is often more important than the original photo itself, and I use Adobe Lightroom because its
        free from the University. I also love to travel, and the photos on my website are from a LA and Bos respectively.
        In the past, I've lived and worked in South Florida (born & raised), Atlanta, Boston, and the Bay Area. I've also
        had the opportunity to visit a few different areas, like upstate NY, NYC, upstate NH, LA/SoCal. A few special parks
        I've visited also include the Salar de Uyuni, Grand Canyon, Muir Woods, Everglades/Big Cypress, and the
        Mojave. Soon I hope to have the chance to visit Acadia.
