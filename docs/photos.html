      <h2>Projects & Approach</h2>
      <p>
        For all of my shots, I try to focus on a good angle or scene, which is usually based on luck, timing, as well as
        photo composition. I usually use the rule of 3rds, because it fits with my landscape-style the best, and it's easy.
        Fun fact - none of these photos were actually taken by my A6000 or Sigma lens. They were all taken on the iPhone
        14 Pro, mostly because I'm lazy to haul around my camera everywhere. Many of the best scenes I've been able to
        witness and take pictures of have been the result of luck and timing. When I assess if a scene is worth photographing,
        I try to see if there's any subject worth focusing on - in these cases, the Christian Science Complex, or the
        Prudential Center, or a Sunset, and factoring in whether the background lighting or mood supports it. I primarily
        prefer darker palettes and settings, over high-contrast bright ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        To improve on my photography, I've recently invested in a new Sigma lens for landscaping, as well as trying to
        take my camera when I go out. The photography I do is not for any story, and doesn't focus on any specific theme,
        but instead I just want to capture a moment, that, in my eyes, is exceptional or connects with me on a deeper level.
